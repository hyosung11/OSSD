## Claude's Answer

It looks like you have some divergent branches in your GitHub repository when trying to pull the latest changes. This happens when the remote branch and your local branch have diverged.

To resolve this, you have a few options:

1. Rebase your local branch onto the remote branch. This will replay your local commits on top of the remote commits:

    ```sh
    git pull --rebase origin main
    ```

2. Merge the remote branch into your local branch. This will create a merge commit:

    ```sh
    git config pull.rebase false
    git pull
    ```

3. Fast-forward your local branch to the remote branch. This will drop any local commits and make your branch point to the same commit as the remote:

    ```sh
    git config pull.ff only
    git pull
    ```

The error suggests setting one of these as your default pull strategy with `git config --global pull.rebase true` or `false`. Typically rebasing or fast-forwarding is preferred to keep a linear commit history, but it depends on your workflow.
