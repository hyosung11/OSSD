- a CV or resume shows prospective employers two things
    1. What you have done for past professional positions and
    2. What difference you've made with those actions
- Prospective employers what someone who made a difference
- resume = what you've done
- portfolio = how you did it
- You need both to share with specific data (numbers)

### FOSS Benefits to Your Personal Network

- Human networking is simply people communicating with other people.
- Communicating while requires practice, intention, and attention.
- "It's not what you know, it's whom you know."
- The most important benefits of these relationships are the discussions, introductions, and information sharing that happens in them.
