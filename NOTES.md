#### Course Timing

RTR <https://trainingportal.linuxfoundation.org/learn/course/a-beginners-guide-to-open-source-software-development-lfc102/course-introduction/before-you-begin?page=2>

This course is entirely self-paced; there is no fixed schedule for going through the material. You can go through the course at your own pace, and you will always be returned to exactly where you left off when you come back to start a new session. However, we still suggest you avoid long breaks in between periods of work, as learning will be faster and content retention improved.

You have unlimited access to this course for 12 months from the date you registered, even after you have completed the course.

The chapters in the course have been designed to build on one another. It is probably best to work through them in sequence; if you skip or only skim some chapters quickly, you may find there are topics being discussed you have not been exposed to yet. But this is all self-paced, and you can always go back, so you can thread your own path through the material.

#### Lab Exercises and Assessments

The labs and knowledge check questions are not graded.

We would also like to emphasize that you will not be required to take a final exam to complete this course.

#### Lab Exercises

In all The Linux Foundation courses (in any format) we put a heavy emphasis on learning by doing. In live, instructor-led classes, we almost always aim for a 50/50 balance between lecture and discussion, and working on laboratory exercises, or homeworks, that either perform the tasks just described in the class, or try more ambitious variations. Instructors help students figure out how to do things, debug their code and scripts, etc., during these lab sessions. Because this course is self-paced, without a live instructor, it will be up to you to control your time budget and make sure you take enough time to do labs.

üì¶
For your convenience, you can also access a single file containing all the lab exercises (LFD102 Labs) by navigating to the Table of Contents located on the left-hand side of the screen and selecting Resources > Files.

You will find lab exercises located throughout the course.

#### Knowledge Check

At the end of each chapter, you will also find a series of knowledge check questions. These questions, just like the labs, were designed with one main goal in mind: to help you better comprehend the course content and reinforce what you have learned.

#### Course Formatting

In order to make it easier to distinguish the various types of content in the course, we use the color coding and formats below:

Dark blue: text typed at the command line

Green: Output

Black: file content

Brown: File/Directory names

Light blue: Hyperlink

You may also notice text boxes with different icons. The purpose of each is clarified below:

## 02. OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE (OSS)

<https://trainingportal.linuxfoundation.org/learn/course/a-beginners-guide-to-open-source-software-development-lfc102/open-source-software-oss/introduction>

### Introduction

#### Introduction to Open Source Software (OSS)

- [x] watch video

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- [ ] Define Open Source Software (OSS) and distinguish between different uses of the word free.
- [ ] Explain the differences between proprietary (closed source) and OSS.
- [ ] Discuss the pragmatic and idealist philosophical strains that inhabit the OSS world, and how they conflict, as well as merge.
- [ ] Sketch out the history of OSS as it evolved from the early days of the computer age to its current, widespread, even dominant use.
- [ ] ‚ÄãExplain and distinguish between different governance models, including Company-Led, Benevolent Dictatorship, and Governing Board.

### What is Open Source Software?

Sharing of software has gone on since the beginnings of the computer age. In fact, not sharing software was the exception, and not the rule. The concepts of Open Source Software (OSS) long predate the use of the term.

There are many models for governance in OSS projects. Each of these models is frequently seen and has its reasons for existence. There is no one method that fits all projects. Contributing to OSS requires learning standard methods and etiquette to do it properly.‚Äã

‚ÄãIn English, the word free has two meanings:

- Free as in free speech, freedom to distribute
- Free as in no cost, or, as is often said, as in "free beer".

Use of the term OSS is partly meant to avoid this confusion, but also to better define what is meant.

We are not going to try and give a detailed definition, but just point out some salient facts which we will discuss in more detail.

Use of OSS means source code is made available with a license which provides rights to examine, modify and redistribute, without restriction on the user's identity or purpose.

üö©
There is a multiplicity of licensing methods, falling into the two general classifications:

- Permissive (such as BSD-licensed software)
- Restrictive (such as GPL-licensed software)

#### Proprietary (Closed Source) Software

Proprietary software had historically been the only real model used by commercial projects until the recent rise of OSS. 

Only the owners of such software projects have full legal access to the source code involved, although they may grant inspection rights to trusted partners who have signed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). For this reason, this model is also called closed source.

The owners of proprietary software projects may or may not be the authors of the code; usually, the authors have been working under contracts giving up their individual rights. Indeed, many such programs are no longer even owned by their originators, but have been passed on through sales over time.

To use proprietary software, end users must accept a license restricting their rights, often through a confusing click-through box presented after a very long and dense description during install.

Such licenses generally restrict the user‚Äôs rights of re-distribution, indemnify the product from damages due to either malfunction or misuse, and prohibit trying to reconstruct source code or use inside another product. They may sometimes restrict how a product is used, but whether such restrictions are legal will vary with details and legal jurisdictions, including country.

üö©
Price is not the point! The difference with OSS and proprietary models has nothing to do with price. One can charge as much as one wants for an open product and one can provide a proprietary product for free. The license differences have to do with redistribution, modification, reuse of code, etc.

#### Pragmatism vs. Idealism

Since its beginning, OSS has had two different philosophical strains: idealistic and pragmatic.

- Idealistic:
  - Here, free means as in freedom, not beer. There is a profound belief that all software should be open for ideological and ethical reasons, not just technological ones.

- Pragmatic:
  - Here, the primary considerations are technical ones, including faster and better development involving more contributors and review, easier debugging, etc.

Note that the more ideological perspective has strong technical imperatives as well, and in many cases, the objectives of both streams coincide. For example:

- Should the software powering a life-saving medical device (such as a pacemaker, or an insulin pump) be secret? Do we not have the right to know what is controlling such devices? How do we know they are not vulnerable to external attacks that can kill us?
- Should the software powering voting machines be closed? How can we be sure we can respect the integrity of tabulated results? This is particularly true when experiment after experiment has shown closed source voting machines to be incredibly easily hacked.

Unfortunately, the conflicts between these two attitudes towards open source has often been acrimonious and destructive. It is unlikely to ever end; the pragmatic approach has most of the economic resources behind it due to corporate buy-in, and the more philosophical camp will always have determined adherents.

#### History of Open Source Software

Open Source Software (OSS) has a long history, although the actual term only dates back to 1998.

Next, we give a timeline for some of the major developments in the world of OSS. We do not mean to be exhaustive or insult anyone by leaving out important steps, as any list is inherently subjective.

Major OSS Developments

The 1950s and Earlier

    Software arose from researchers, both academic and corporate
    Distributed openly and cooperatively
    Source always distributed, binaries less often
    Software not seen as separate commodity
