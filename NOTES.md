#### Meet Your Instructor: Jerry Cooperstein

Jerry Cooperstein, PhD has been working with Linux since 1994, developing and delivering training in both the kernel and user space. During a two decade career in nuclear astrophysics, he developed state-of-the-art simulation software on many kinds of supercomputers and taught at both the undergraduate and graduate level. Jerry joined The Linux Foundation in 2009. He is currently a Senior Content Manager for The Linux Foundation.

#### Course Support

One great way to interact with peers taking this course is via the [Class Forum](https://forum.linuxfoundation.org/discussion/863974/introduction-of-myself#latest). The forum can be used in the following ways:

- To introduce yourself to other peers taking this course
- To discuss concepts, tools and technologies presented in this course, or related to the topics discussed in the course materials
- To ask questions or report issues with labs or course content
- To provide solutions/suggestions to peer learners
- To review issues that were already raised, including possible solutions - the forum can be a great learning resource as well, and you may find that your questions have already been - answered in previous posts
- To share resources and ideas related to Linux system administration

Please note that all announcements regarding course updates are posted in the forum, so we highly recommend that you periodically check it out.

If you have questions regarding your course enrollment, you can reach out to us via our [Customer Support system](https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/15). You will be required to login with your LF Account, which will help us to quickly locate your account and respond to your request. This will also allow you to track your support request through to resolution, and create an ongoing record of your support requests.

The Linux Foundation Training & Certification Customer Support system also offers enhanced functionality, such as:

- Knowledge Base Articles - to help you find a quick response to your commonly asked questions
- Service Request Forms - asking the right questions so that you can get the right answers.

#### Course Timing

RTR <https://trainingportal.linuxfoundation.org/learn/course/a-beginners-guide-to-open-source-software-development-lfc102/course-introduction/before-you-begin?page=2>

This course is entirely self-paced; there is no fixed schedule for going through the material. You can go through the course at your own pace, and you will always be returned to exactly where you left off when you come back to start a new session. However, we still suggest you avoid long breaks in between periods of work, as learning will be faster and content retention improved.

You have unlimited access to this course for 12 months from the date you registered, even after you have completed the course.

The chapters in the course have been designed to build on one another. It is probably best to work through them in sequence; if you skip or only skim some chapters quickly, you may find there are topics being discussed you have not been exposed to yet. But this is all self-paced, and you can always go back, so you can thread your own path through the material.

#### Lab Exercises and Assessments

The labs and knowledge check questions are not graded.

We would also like to emphasize that you will not be required to take a final exam to complete this course.

#### Lab Exercises

In all The Linux Foundation courses (in any format) we put a heavy emphasis on learning by doing. In live, instructor-led classes, we almost always aim for a 50/50 balance between lecture and discussion, and working on laboratory exercises, or homeworks, that either perform the tasks just described in the class, or try more ambitious variations. Instructors help students figure out how to do things, debug their code and scripts, etc., during these lab sessions. Because this course is self-paced, without a live instructor, it will be up to you to control your time budget and make sure you take enough time to do labs.

ðŸ“¦
For your convenience, you can also access a single file containing all the lab exercises (LFD102 Labs) by navigating to the Table of Contents located on the left-hand side of the screen and selecting Resources > Files.

You will find lab exercises located throughout the course.

#### Knowledge Check

At the end of each chapter, you will also find a series of knowledge check questions. These questions, just like the labs, were designed with one main goal in mind: to help you better comprehend the course content and reinforce what you have learned.
